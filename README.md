# Cloud-Domination
This project is to demonstrate which cloud platform is dominant per state.


The first question many new cloud engineers ask is what cloud platform should I learn from the big three? The most common answer to this question that I have found is to study the platform that has the most job postings in your area. 

The next step in your journey to becoming a cloud engineer is to deploy some personal projects in the cloud to earn some experience. Thatâ€™s when I decided to pull all cloud job postings into one place to truly see which cloud platform is dominant.

The following is my infrastructure design for this project.
